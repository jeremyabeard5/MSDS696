Tableau Prep Builder
	Have filtered data (ship mode = 'first class')
	Creating calculated fields from existing fields
	Applied merges, unions
	Used common characters to consolidate input error from users
	Removed letters, creating numeric fields from string fields
	
Normal Forms	
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFQaEYEc8_8
1NF - First Normal Form
	No mixing datatypes
	Always have primary key
	Order doesn't matter
	Don't have repeating data items in one row (Item 1, Qty 1, Item 2, Qty 2, etc.)
	
2NF
	Each non-key attribute must depend on the entire primary key (if there are multiple keys/parts of the key)
		(when 'Player_ID' and 'Item_Type' are keys in a table but 'Player_Rating' only depends on 'Player_ID')
	Solution: separate out into different tables which are both normalized to 2NF
	
3NF
	Forbids dependency of non-key attributes on each other ('Player_Rating' depending on 'Player_Skill_Level')
	Solution: Remove the attributes which are dependent, and add a decoder ring table
	"Every attribute in a table should depend on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key" (Boyce-Codd NF)

turquoise slice
	healtchare price transparency
		legislation passed "hospital price transparency rule"
		states payers/providers mandated to publicize pricing data
		people don't know how much they are going to pay
		hospitals and insurance companies didn't have the data
	co-founders spent a lot of time in the health space
	the raw data is virtually useless
		messy unstructured
		organized by medical billing code, CPT code
	processing petabytes of data on a monthly data
	scrapes data from thousands of sources, into ONE platform
	B2B org (work with other businesses)
	SMB arm (private practices, independent services)
	
	where does data science come in?
		~35 engineers total
			3 groups
				data eng, data sci, product eng
					eng: raw data ingestion and processing
					prod: different B2B products,
						have contracting products, etc
					sci: data products, help customer derive value from collected data
						have to understand the "WHY" so you can do the "HOW"
						data pipelines, data cleaning
						collaborating with data product managers, solutions engineers(customer-facing), 
						working in Python, SQL, Tableau
					Location: remote
						once a quarter we have a team or company offsite
					Interviewing Process:
					Salary Band: 125-155
	A lot of people out for the holidays
		do technical interview with hiring manager (Python)
			wiith Maya
		one SQL interview, one product interview, one Python interview
