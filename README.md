# Main Ideas
This project is centered around an effort to scrape real-time flights and utilize it for a prediction model.

The project will utilize a variety

# Problem Statement

The main problem we were seeking to solve is "how can we reliably predict trends with flight prices in order to leverage the best days to travel?" 

Obviously there are websites which exist today that serve to find the cosumer the cheapest flights for a specific time period and destination, but these websites are often slow and filled with advertisements. 

The tool I will build seeks to serve as an initial check into which days and which airlines should be noted as typically the cheaper options for a specific route and specific day. Using my tool, the user can view trends in flights prices and can input a specific route to view what the predicted price will be on that day, within +/- $20.

# Methods

The project involves two (2) main efforts for predicting these flight prices. The overall process though is pretty simple and is as follows:

* Figure out a way to scrape real flights from the internet to create a database

* Take data from real flights and do comparative analysis on different ML models in order to create the most accurate 

Once we scrape all the flights we need and perform the comparative analysis, we will have a machine learning model that is Denver-focused and can help to quickly assist the user in selecting a flight which is satisfactory to them.

I also utilized all of my old text-based homework assignments for references.

Aside from that, I utilized www.phind.com for unimportant technical questions where I couldn't remember specific syntax of certain operations. I also heavily referenced the matplotlib documentation for assistance with visualization items.
