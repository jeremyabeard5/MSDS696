# Main Ideas

This project is centered around an effort to scrape real-time flights and utilize it for a price prediction model. An Application Programming Interface (API) was utilized (LIIIIIIIIIIINK) in order to obtain ~45,000 real flights, primarily from United, American, and Frontier Airlines. 

The project will utilize a variety

# Problem Statement

The main problem we were seeking to solve is "how can we reliably predict trends with flight prices in order to leverage the best days, times, and airlines on which to travel?" 

Obviously there are websites which exist today that serve to find consumers the cheapest flights for a specific time period and destination, but these websites are often slow and filled with advertisements and depend on an internet connection. The model shown in this repository, while being built upon a dataset which relies on an internet connection, can act independently of an internet connection and is without advertisements.  

The tool built seeks to serve as an initial check into which days and which airlines should be noted as typically the cheaper options for a specific route and specific day. Using this tool, the user can view trends in flight prices and can input a specific route to view what the predicted price will be on that day, within +/- $20.

# Methods

This project involves four (4) main efforts for predicting these flight prices. The overall process though is pretty simple and is as follows:

* Figure out a way to scrape real flights from the internet to create a large database with which to create a model.

* Perform exploratory data analytics on the flight database, ensuring data is clean prepared for model analytics.

* Create a Tableau dashboard to see at-a-glance which days, weeks, months, and airlines are cheapest for flying.

* Take data from the flight database and do comparative analysis on different ML models in order to create the most accurate model for predicting flight prices.

Once we scrape all the flights we need and perform the comparative analysis, we will have a machine learning model that is Denver-focused and can help to quickly assist the user in selecting a flight which is satisfactory to them!

I also utilized all of my old text-based homework assignments for references.

Aside from that, I utilized www.phind.com for unimportant technical questions where I couldn't remember specific syntax of certain operations. I also heavily referenced the matplotlib documentation for assistance with visualization items.
