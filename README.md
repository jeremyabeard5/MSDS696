## 1-gram / 2-gram / 3-gram Charts of Interest

I found that the 2-gram charts were really the "sweet spot" in terms of useful information. 1-gram charts (or, the common word charts) didn't really give much information, and 3-gram charts were more general and less specific than the 2-gram charts. I included a few of the 2-gram and 3-gram charts below. For a complete list of all the 1-gram/2-gram/3-gram charts, please see the 'output' folder of my project.

The dataset I used was located at: 


I also utilized all of my old text-based homework assignments for references.

Aside from that, I utilized www.phind.com for unimportant technical questions where I couldn't remember specific syntax of certain operations. I also heavily referenced the matplotlib documentation for assistance with visualization items.
